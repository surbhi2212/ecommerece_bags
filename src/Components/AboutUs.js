Meticulously handcrafted, our range of formal clutch purses, potlis, wallets, slings and tote bags are a testament to the virtuosity of our local artisans and their passion to bring into being our design concepts that are an amalgamation of traditional fabric and modern form. </div>

               <div style={{display:'flex', justifyContent:'center', textAlign:'center', margin:'4rem'}}>In 2014, Priyanka our creative head started experimenting with making fabric bags at her parents' garment manufacturing factory. After receiving great feedback on the first collection, she decided to launch the label - AMYRA meaning 'of or belonging to a princess'. What followed was 4 years of researching the market, working with numerous clients, understanding their requirements & design flavor and suiting designs to their need. This culminated into a niche product line of stunning fabric bags, designed with love and passion to break the creative boundaries, so our beautiful clients can carry a product that is luxurious in every form and complements their look.

The AMYRA Store was launched back in Aug’18 to take this venture global. </div>
